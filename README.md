This is a Flask API which was part of the tech stack of my Startup Pixli. 

The user uploads image to the app which is stored in AWS S3. The link to the photo and its thumbnail is stored in Postgres database along with other user and event details.
The API grabs information from the databse and send it to the user. It also handles the user authentication session tokens.
