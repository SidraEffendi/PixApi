This Flask API was part of the tech stack of my Startup Pixli. 

The user uploads an image to the app, which is stored in AWS S3. The link to the photos is stored in a Postgres database along with other user and event details.
The API grabs information from the database and sends it to the user app. It also handles the user authentication session tokens.
